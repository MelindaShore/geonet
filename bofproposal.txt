. Description, including whether the BoF is intended to form
  a WG or not:

  IP routing and addressing are done without knowledge of
  the geographic location of participating nodes.
  Standardized, interoperable mechanisms are needed to
  provide authorized source nodes anywhere in the internet
  to disseminate packets to nodes based on geographic
  location, while preserving the privacy of senders and
  receivers. Scenarios under discussion include the sender
  sending to nodes in a given geographic area while not
  knowing their identity, senders knowing the identity of
  the nodes receiving the packets, and nodes communicating
  their location to senders. The goal of this BOF is to
  clarify which scenarios will fall within the scope of a
  working group, assess interest levels, and identify
  potential contributors.

  This is a working group-forming BOF.
