Charter Proposal
----------------

The group is concerned with Internet-wide geonetworking.

IP routing and addressing are completely unaware of geography
parameters.  Mechanisms and IETF protocols are needed for authorized
source nodes anywhere in the Internet to disseminate packets to other
nodes in areas described by geographical parameters, all while
respecting privacy concerns of sender and receiver; parameters such as
geographical coordinates and other geo-locators such as civic
addresses should be used.

The challenges associated with Internet-wide Geonetworking that could
be addressed at IETF are:
* agree on accurate representations of geospatial information which
  could be used by IP routing and addressing, and that is relevant to
  many countries.
* reuse or design new translation or mapping mechanisms between
  geographical and other types of location representation and IP
  addresses.
* forward IP packets according to additional criteria such as physical
  location identifiers.

The main use-cases are:
* dissemination to a geographical area
* goods tracking
* vehicular traffic safety, efficiency, management and infotainment
* mobile road-side unit
* identification of originating area
*o geolocation of instrumented ambulance

Protocol work would begin after completion of these work items listed
below, and upon rechartering.
